## Installation
Python ver 3 is the only requirement for this code.

## Project Motivation
This is a requirement of Udacity nandegree project.  I was inspired to do a piece on data from Trinidad and Tobago as I am a Trinidadian citizen.  I have never previously explored the statistics associated with my home country and so took this as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of T&T's economic and social workings.

Key focus areas:

1. Under whose rule did GDP grow the most?
2. Understand if there is any impact to GDP growth as the country invests in energy.
3. What is the correlation between investment in education and unemployment?

## File Descriptions

indicators_tto.csv is data taken from the World Bank data portal and spans a period from 1960 to 2019.  It contains data covering the following topics: Agriculture and Rural Development, Aid Effectiveness, Economy and Growth, Education, Energy and Mining, Environment, Financial Sector, Health, Infrastructure, Social Protection and Labor, Poverty, Private Sector, Public Sector, Science and Technology, Social Development, Urban Development, Gender, Climate Change, External Debt, Trade.

Blog Post - Assessment of T&T statistics.ipynb is the jupyter notebook of my assessment

## Results
It was found that:
1. UNC led the country through the highest periods of economic growth followed by the PNM.  It should be noted from the scatter plot however, that PNM led the country over a greater period including periods of global economic downturns.  This justifies deepening the understanding of factors which impacted GDP growth to be covered in the next section.
2. As the energy spend increases, GDP growth decreases.
3. Overall, the higher the spend on education (measured by Adjusted savings: education expenditure), the lower the unemployment.  This was found to be the strongest correlation. 
Weaker correlations are also observed in the data above:
- increasing the propotion of government expenditure in Teritiary school correlates to a decrease in unemployment. 
- decreasing the proportion of government expenditure in Primary and Secondary school correlates to a decrease in unemployment.
